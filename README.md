Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute: Since GitHub repos can only tell you so much, let me tell you about the woman behind the code.

I've got two young children and a full time job as a Team Lead / Supervisor for technical support, but my dream is to become a Front-End Engineer.

Whenever I get the chance, I'm learning about web development, UI design principles, and a little bit of back-end stuff.
Special thanks to Zero to Mastery Academy and Profy.Dev, where I am studying best developer practices. 

So far I've got experience with the following:
  * JavaScript
  * React.js (including redux, hooks)
  * Node.js
  * Some React Native
  * Pixel-perfect design using Figma
  * Proper workflow when committing to GitHub repos in a team

I'm also a woman with ambition! I've got a few ideas for my own app and small business, but I'll need some funds before I can bring these ideas to life.

More importantly, my favorite things include ~
  * Marvel movies and TV shows
  * Cool shows on Netflix (Shadow and Bone, The Good Place, New Girl)
  * TASTY FOOD! If I'm not currently eating, I am thinking about what to try next.
  * Music - I'm planning to take singing lessons, and also join a dance class if I find one in the area.

If you'd like to chat with me about how I'd be a great addition to your team, hit me up (^_^)
