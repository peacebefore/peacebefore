Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute: Since GitHub repos can only tell you so much, let me tell you about the woman behind the code.

I come from a background in English and creative writing, with experience in project management, business operations, and customer success at SaaS startups. With my Salesforce Platform Developer I and Salesforce Administrator certifications, I'm excited to shift into full-time platform development and engineering. 

Some other favorite hobbies ~
  * Watching Marvel movies and TV shows, or cool shows on Netflix (Great British Bake-Off, The Good Place, New Girl)
  * Eating TASTY FOOD! If I'm not currently eating, I am thinking about what to try next.
  * Singing, dancing & listening to music

Please reach out if you'd like to chat! (^_^)
