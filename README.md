Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute:

My professional journey, which spans over 7 years, has taken me through various roles in engineering and operations, from dynamic startups to established corporations. My goal? Crafting solutions that aren't just smart, but also scalable and efficient.

Right now, I'm on the lookout for fresh challenges, hoping to bring my mix of technical know-how and big-picture thinking into a space that's all about pioneering and growth. I'm excited for you to see how my passion and adaptability can really make an impact. Looking forward to connecting soon!
