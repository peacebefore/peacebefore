Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute:

I'm an enthusiastic problem-solver specializing in machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and the fascinating world of generative AI. My professional journey, which spans over 7 years, has taken me through various roles in engineering and operations, from dynamic startups to established corporations. 

My goal? Crafting machine learning models that aren't just smart, but also scalable and efficient. What really drives me is the desire to create intuitive machine learning systems that enhance what we humans can do. Imagine pushing the boundaries of our creativity and innovation, all while eliminating repetitive tasks! 

Right now, I'm on the lookout for fresh challenges, hoping to bring my mix of technical know-how and big-picture thinking into a space that's all about pioneering and growth. I'm excited for you to see how my passion and adaptability can really make an impact. Let's see what we can build!
