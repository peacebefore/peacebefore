Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute: Since GitHub repos can only tell you so much, let me tell you about the woman behind the code.

I come from a background in English and creative writing, with experience in project management, business operations, and customer success at SaaS startups. Super excited to help companies improve internal processes and drive growth through innovative business strategies.

Some other favorite hobbies ~
  * Watching Marvel movies and TV shows, or cool shows on Netflix (Great British Bake-Off, The Good Place, New Girl)
  * Eating TASTY FOOD! If I'm not currently eating, I am thinking about what to try next.
  * Singing, dancing & listening to music

Please reach out if you'd like to chat! (^_^)
