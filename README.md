Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute:

I'm an enthusiastic problem-solver who loves taking on projects and challenges that improve my understanding of technology, data, and human nature. I'm particularly interested in the way we can use the tools and products we create to improve our standard of living and wellbeing as a society. My professional journey, which spans over 7 years, has taken me through various roles in operations and data analysis, at dynamic startups and established corporations. My goal is optimizing processes to be smart, scalable, and efficient.
