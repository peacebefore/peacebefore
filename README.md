Nice to meet you! I'm Priya. :vulcan_salute: Since GitHub repos can only tell you so much, let me tell you about the woman behind the code.

I currently work full time as a Team Lead for technical customer support, but my dream is to become a Front-End Engineer.

Skills & Highlights -
  * JavaScript
  * HTML, CSS, and styled-components
  * React (including Redux, React Router, Context API & Hooks)
  * Some NodeJS, SQL
  * Some React Native
  * API integrations (Firebase, Google Cloud & Stripe)
  * Pixel-perfect design using Figma
  * Proper workflow when committing to GitHub repos in a team

Whenever I get the chance, I'm learning about web development, UI design principles, and a little bit of back-end stuff.
Special thanks to Zero to Mastery Academy and Profy.Dev, where I am studying best developer practices. 

Some other favorite hobbies ~
  * Watching Marvel movies and TV shows, or cool shows on Netflix (Shadow and Bone, The Good Place, New Girl)
  * Eating TASTY FOOD! If I'm not currently eating, I am thinking about what to try next.
  * Listening to and playing music - I sometimes play ukulele with my husband and plan to take singing lessons in the near future so we can play more songs together.

Please reach out if you'd like to chat! (^_^)
